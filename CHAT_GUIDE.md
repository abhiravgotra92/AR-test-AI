## 🔧 Technical Details

### Architecture:
```
User 1 sends message
    ↓
Saves to localStorage (instant)
    ↓
Renders on screen (instant)
    ↓
Uploads to JSONKeeper API
    ↓
User 2 polls server (every 2s)
    ↓
Downloads new messages
    ↓
Renders on User 2's screen
```

### Polling Cycle:
- Every 2 seconds, chat checks server for new messages
- If new messages found → download and display
- If no new messages → skip update
- Continues while chat is open
- Stops when chat is closed
